excerpt: >-
  Every software engineer knows the shape of a good workday. You don't walk in,
  wave your

  hands, and hope the code appears. You clock in, read the ticket, think about the data flow,

  write a plan, build it in small verifiable chunks, get it reviewed, and when it's merged you

  pack up and go home. The workspace you occupied for those eight hours isn't sacred. It's a

  disposable seat you leave behind.

 The **Forge-Sentinel pair** is that workday, automated. Two agents, **FORGE** the builder and
**SENTINEL** the reviewer, are provisioned as a 1:1 pair to complete exactly one task.
They are armed with a curated arsenal of commands, skills, hooks, and tools that force the
work to happen *architecturally* rather than by feel. And when the task is done, the whole
thing (workspaces, state, locks, context) is destroyed, leaving only a merged PR and a
clean slot ready for the next ticket.

This is not another "autonomous coding agent" demo. It's a discipline. Let's walk through
how the pair operates.

## One ticket, one pair, one branch

Before either agent does anything, **NEXUS** (the orchestrator) takes a GitHub issue and
assigns it to an idle pair slot. That assignment is a promise of full isolation:

- Each pair gets its own **Git worktree** on its own branch (`forge-pair-1/T-42`). Two pairs
  never share a checkout, never touch the same branch.
- Each pair gets its own **`shared/` directory**: the only channel where FORGE and SENTINEL
  talk to each other. Tickets, plans, contracts, evaluations all live there.
- Dynamic **file locks** guarantee two pairs can't stomp the same file even when scope grows.

The pair is *scoped* to the task from the moment it's born. FORGE cannot see what forge-2 is
doing. It has no reason to. Its entire universe is `TICKET.md`, its worktree, and the shared
directory where SENTINEL will reply.

## Armed with curated commands and skills, not vibes

A pair is only as reliable as its tooling. Neither agent is handed a blank chat and told
"go figure it out." Each is **provisioned with a purpose-built orchestration plugin**:
skills, hooks, slash commands, and MCP servers that encode *how* the work gets done.

And crucially, this arsenal is not static. It **compounds over time**. Every hard-won lesson
from the engineering organization is folded back into the plugin: battle-tested skills,
refined design principles, coding standards, architecture patterns, API contracts, and
review guidelines. Each new ticket the pair runs is executed against the accumulated
experience of every ticket before it. FORGE doesn't rediscover "how we write async error
handling here" on its own, and SENTINEL doesn't re-learn "what an acceptable PR looks like."
That knowledge is codified and handed to them at session start. The pair is armed with a
living, growing playbook, not a one-off prompt.

### Skills: injected knowledge, not prompt bloat

On session start, each agent receives the skills relevant to its role as reference documents:

- **FORGE** loads `forge-planning` and `forge-coding`, the discipline of writing a plan
  before code, sizing segments (1–3 files, 20–40 minutes), and testing every new function.
- **SENTINEL** loads `sentinel-review` and `sentinel-criteria`, the five evaluation
  criteria (correctness, test coverage, standards compliance, code quality, no regressions)
  that every approval must pass.

The skills don't make the agents *capable*; they make them *consistent*. FORGE doesn't
wonder whether it should test; the skill says every new function needs a test, and the hook
enforces it.

### Hooks: invariants the agent cannot bypass

Skills are suggestions; hooks are law. Lifecycle hooks run around every action and refuse
to let the agent skip the process:

- **FORGE**: a `pre_write_check` hook enforces file ownership locks before every write; a
  `post_write_lint` hook runs the linter on every changed file; a `pre_bash_guard` blocks
  dangerous commands like direct `git push`; a `stop_require_artifact` hook **refuses to let
  FORGE exit** until it has produced a valid `STATUS.json` or `HANDOFF.md`.
- **SENTINEL**: a `pre_bash_readonly_guard` makes the reviewer read-only against source. It
  can run tests and linters but cannot modify a single line of FORGE's code; a
  `stop_require_eval` hook refuses exit until an evaluation is written.

The message is blunt: *you don't get to leave until the work is finished and recorded.*
That's the equivalent of an engineer being told the ticket isn't done until the PR is up and
the tests are green.

### Commands: structured procedures

Slash commands bundle multi-step procedures so the agent doesn't improvise the workflow:

- `/plan`: reads the ticket, searches the codebase for existing patterns, and writes a
  structured `PLAN.md` with segment breakdown and definition of done.
- `/segment-done`: runs the full test suite, lints changed files, commits the segment, and
  notifies SENTINEL.
- `/handoff`: writes a complete handoff and exits cleanly when context runs low.
- `/status`: verifies the final review is approved, pushes the branch, opens the PR via the
  GitHub MCP server, and records the terminal `STATUS.json`.

### MCP servers: external capability, scoped

Rather than build a custom tool binary, the pair is wired to **battle-tested MCP servers**
(GitHub, Redis, filesystem, shell), each scoped to the pair's own worktree and credentials.
FORGE can open a PR through GitHub MCP; the shell server only allows an explicit allowlist
(`run-tests.sh`, `cargo test`, `eslint`, `ruff`). The agent gets real capability with
constraints that make it safe to run unattended.

## The gated workflow: planning → building → reviewing

The pair's rhythm is a **series of hard gates**. FORGE cannot skip ahead, and SENTINEL
cannot approve without evidence.

### 1. The planning gate

FORGE reads the ticket, searches the codebase for existing patterns, and writes `PLAN.md`:
its understanding of the ticket, the technical approach, an explicit segment breakdown, a
testable definition of done per segment, and an out-of-scope list. It then sets
`status set planning` and **halts**.

The harness watches the shared directory and, on seeing the plan, spawns a fresh SENTINEL
to review it *before a single line of code is written*. SENTINEL checks whether the plan
addresses every acceptance criterion, whether the approach follows the codebase's
architecture patterns, and whether the definition of done is actually testable. It writes
`CONTRACT.md`: either `AGREED` or a list of specific objections.

If there are objections, the plan goes back. After **three rounds** of disagreement, the
ticket is blocked and escalated. No code was written during any of this. The architecture
was agreed *first*. This is the pair's refusal to build on vibes.

### 2. The segment loop

Only after gate approval does FORGE set `status set building` and begin implementation, in
small, independently verifiable segments. After each segment:

1. FORGE runs the full test suite. It must pass.
2. FORGE runs the linter. Zero warnings.
3. FORGE commits and signals `/segment-done`.
4. The harness spawns a **fresh, ephemeral SENTINEL** to evaluate *that one segment*.

SENTINEL runs the tests, lints the changed files, reads every changed file against the
contract, and evaluates against the five criteria. Feedback is never vague. Every finding
is `file:line:problem:fix`, e.g.:

> `src/auth/login.ts:23`: Missing error handling for `fetchUser()`. Required: Add try-catch
> with `AppError('USER_NOT_FOUND', 404)`.

If SENTINEL requests changes, FORGE fixes *exactly those items*, not a refactor, and
re-submits. Each re-submission spawns a fresh SENTINEL with zero memory of the previous one.
That freshness is deliberate.

### 3. Final review and the PR

When every segment is approved, SENTINEL spawns once more for a **final review**: the full
test suite, the full linter, every contract criterion. On approval it writes
`final-review.md` with an `APPROVED` verdict and, importantly, the PR description.

FORGE then pushes the branch and opens the PR through GitHub MCP, using SENTINEL's own
write-up as the body. It records `STATUS.json` and exits. **VESSEL**, a separate
deterministic agent, checks CI and merges. The pair's job is done.

## The destroy: ephemeral by design

Here is where the pair departs from most "agent" systems and starts to resemble a real
engineer's workday: **everything is disposable, and everything is destroyed when the task is
done.**

- **SENTINEL is not a long-running process.** It is spawned fresh for *every* evaluation:
  plan review, each segment, the final review. It exits as soon as it has written its
  verdict. It has no history, no future, only the one segment in front of it. This guarantees
  **zero context drift**: the reviewer of segment 3 has no memory or bias from segment 2. It
  cannot be talked into approving something it saw "last time," because there was no last time.
- **The worker workspace is disposable.** Each pair runs in a short-lived Coder workspace
  that holds no credentials, no LLM keys, and no agent framework. The workspace is a *seat*,
  not a home.
- **On completion, the harness tears the pair down.** The worktree is removed and recreated
  idle on `main`. File locks owned by the pair are released. The `shared/` artifacts that
  carried the whole conversation (plans, contracts, evaluations, status) are runtime state,
  explicitly gitignored, never committed. The slot returns to `IDLE`, ready for the next
  ticket.

There is no "agent garden" of long-lived reviewers accumulating context and ego. There is a
slot that gets provisioned, does its eight-hour job, and gets reset.

## Why the destroy matters

Ephemerality isn't just convenient. It's the source of the system's trustworthiness. Three
consequences fall out of it:

1. **No context drift.** A reviewer that has seen 40 PRs has opinions. A reviewer that is
   born, evaluates one thing, and dies has only the evidence in front of it. The pair's
   quality bar is constant because the reviewer is always fresh.
2. **No state rot.** Long-running agents accumulate stale assumptions, half-finished
   workflows, and locked files. The pair's teardown sweeps all of it away. An idle slot is a
   *guaranteed-clean* slot.
3. **Isolation is real.** Because FORGE and SENTINEL live in separate, disposable
   workspaces, adversarial review is honest: SENTINEL can run FORGE's tests but can never
   touch FORGE's filesystem. It either sees evidence, or it blocks.

## Architecture over vibe

The contrast the pair is built around is the difference between an engineer who "feels" the
feature is done and one who *knows* it is:

- **Plan before code**: the architecture is agreed and written down before implementation.
- **Small verifiable segments**: each one tested, linted, and reviewed on its own.
- **Machine-readable handshake**: the controller consumes a harness command's Redis write,
  not a `STATUS.json` file the agent might forget. The verdict is recorded by a command, not
  by hope.
- **Hard-fail on missing evidence**: SENTINEL must *hard-fail, never approve*, when a
  required artifact is missing or unreadable. Unknown ≠ pass.
- **No partial credit**: a PR either earns its merge against the contract, or it goes back.

That is an eight-hour shift in miniature: clock in, read the ticket, plan, build in reviewable
chunks, get it reviewed, ship it, and tear down the seat you occupied. The Forge-Sentinel
pair is what it looks like when software engineering stops being a vibe and becomes a
**discipline with a teardown clause**, and the only thing left behind is the merged feature.
